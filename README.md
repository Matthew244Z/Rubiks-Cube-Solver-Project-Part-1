# Rubiks-Cube-Solver-Project-Part-1

This is the first step towards my persoal goal - create a robot to solve a rubik's cube on its own.

I decided to write in C++ beucase I had C++ for one of my university courses. So, it was the language that I was most familiar with at the time I wrote the program,
and I wanted to apply what I learned in class. 

The program reads a file containing the scramble algorithm of a rubik's cube. Then, the program runs a series of functions and tests, and outputs a solution algorithm at the end.

A 2D array was used to store the data of the rubik's cubes. The program constantly reallocates the data on the 2D array to simulate the movements on a rubik's cube. 

Later I used this program as a basis for a website, which is also on my repository.
